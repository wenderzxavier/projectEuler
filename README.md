# Project Euler Solutions #

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

You can learn more about at [Project Euler's Website](https://projecteuler.net/about).

## Solutions
All solutions on this repository were developed by the author. No piece of code was copied from third parties.

Fell free to take a look and improve them! (I did not use the most effective approach on the problems such as parallel execution or hashmaps. So there is a lot of room to improve!)

## Dependencies
You must have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your machine.

## Run
You just need to run on terminal the following script:
```
node  [index.js FILE LOCATION] [PROBLEM ID]
```

Don't forget the 0 on the problems from 1 ~ 9.
(Ex: `node index.js 09`)
